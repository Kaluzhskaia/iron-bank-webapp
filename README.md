# Iron Bank Webapp

Web application of a Game of Thrones-style Iron Bank. The clients can take loans with good interest. Overdrawing the payment deadline is expensive, though - clients pay with their lives!

The project aims to teach approaches to iterative software development processes such as RUP.
